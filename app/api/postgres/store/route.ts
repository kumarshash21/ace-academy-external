 * POST /api/postgres/store

 * (`{collection, docId, data}` -> any doc, any shape). Postgres has a fixed
 * relational schema, so there's no equivalent generic write — every table
 * now has its own typed endpoint (see the other modules under
 * ACE-Academy-backend/src/modules/). No caller in this repo used this route;
 * kept as a stub (instead of deleted) in case something external still
 * points at it, so that caller gets a clear error instead of a silent 404
 * or a write that goes nowhere.
